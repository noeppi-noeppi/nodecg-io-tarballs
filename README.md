# Tarballs to use as dependencies in npm for nodecg-io

To use one of those as a dependency in npm pu the following in your `dependencies` section:

```
"nodecg-io-core": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noeppi-noeppi/nodecg-io-tarballs/master/nodecg-io-core.tar.gz"
"nodecg-io-twitch": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noeppi-noeppi/nodecg-io-tarballs/master/nodecg-io-twitch.tar.gz"
```

I'll try to keep this as up-to-date as possible.
